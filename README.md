## Requirements

To install all dependencies at once, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### requirements.txt

```
requests
beautifulsoup4
```


---

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- `requests` – for making HTTP requests.
- `BeautifulSoup` (from `bs4`) – for parsing HTML content.

---

## How It Works

1. Takes user input for how many pages to scrape.
2. Requests and parses each page of Hacker News.
3. Extracts story titles, links, and votes.
4. Sorts the extracted data based on votes.
5. Displays sorted results per page.

---

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3 installed
- Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

### Run the script

```bash
python main.py
```

Then input the number of pages to scrape when prompted.

---

## Sample Output

```
Enter the number of pages to scrape: 1

Hacker_news (page : 1) :
[
 {'title': 'Project X: AI system beats humans', 'link': 'https://...', 'votes': 342},
 {'title': 'How I built a game in 2 days', 'link': 'https://...', 'votes': 231},
 ...
]
```
